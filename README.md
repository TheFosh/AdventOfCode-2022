# AdventOfCode-2022
## My files for completing [advent of code, 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I started on the 19th of december and stopped after christmas. Got to complete both parts of problems 1-5.
1. Calorie Counting: Counted the total amount of calories of each elf to find who has the most and how much they have.
2. Rock Paper Scissors: Calculated the score of a given list of senarios of a rock paper scissors tournament.
3. Rucksack Reorganization: Given a list of letters found in a rucksack I needed to find the one that was on both halfs of the bag.
4. Camp Cleanup: Was given ranges of where elfs cleaned sections and tasked to find which ones overlapped.
5. Supply Stacks: Given a formation of labbed crates and moving instructions, I found out which crates were on top of their stacks at th eend of the instructions.
## Will maybe do more after.
